## Building an End-to-End LLM Project with RAG and AI Agents

#### Custom Document QA
The FAISS vectorstore is used to retrieve documents relevant to a userâ€™s query. The query and context are passed to the LLM to generate a meaningful response.

#### Real-time Web Search
**Tavily** lets you add real-time web search capability to your AI agents.

### CrewAI Agents
Agents **collaborate** to achieve a shared objective (e.g., generate a report or perform research).

### End-to-End Framework
Create an API using flask/django or frontend using streamlit.

### Containerisation
Dockerise the flask API/streamlit app for deployment.
